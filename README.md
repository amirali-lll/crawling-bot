# AI Crawling Bot 🐛

An educational crawling robot platform designed for AI students. This project provides everything needed to design, build, and program an autonomous crawling robot — including 3D models, firmware, logic templates, and full documentation.

---

## 📦 What’s Inside

- `template.ino`: This is the starting point for your AI logic. Modify it to define how the robot should behave.
- 3D models in Rhino and export formats for viewing or printing.
- Guides for assembly, deployment, and usage.
- Diagrams and images for wiring and construction help.

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amirali-lll/crawling-bot.git
```

### 2. Open and Edit the Logic Template

Modify the file:

```bash
templates/template.ino
```

Use it to define how the robot should behave. You’ll write AI logic here.

### 3. Upload Logic

Follow the steps in the [User Guide](docs/installation.md) to upload your logic to the robot.

## 🧱 Repository Structure

| Folder | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| `templates/` | Starter `.ino` logic file to customize |
| `designs/` | 3D robot designs in Rhino (`.3dm`) and export formats (`.stl`, `.obj`) |
| `docs/` | Written guides, wiring diagrams, and usage instructions |

---

## 🖨️ 3D Model Exports

In the `designs/` directory:
- `robot-design.3dm` — original Rhino model
- `exports/robot.stl`, `robot.obj` — printable and viewable 3D exports
- `exploded-view.png` — visual reference for assembly
