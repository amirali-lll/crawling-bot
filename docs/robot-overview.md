# Robot Overview 🦾

This document provides an overview of the main hardware components used in the AI Crawling Bot. Each part is essential for the robot’s operation and is shown below with a visual reference.

## 0. The Power Button 🔘
The most important part of the robot is the power button. It is used to turn on and off the robot. The power button is located on the side of the robot, at the bottom of the battery compartment.
And make sure to turn it off when you are not using the robot to save battery life.

## 1. Microcontroller (ESP32) with Micro-USB Port 🧠🔌

The ESP32 is the brain of the robot, responsible for running the AI logic and controlling all other components. It connects to your computer via a micro-USB port for programming and power.

## 4. Servo Motors (2x) ⚙️🤖

Two servo motors are used to control the movement of the robot’s legs or wheels, allowing it to crawl or steer.
The MG90S micro servo is a common choice for this purpose due to its compact size and sufficient torque.
> **Note:** Micro servos like the MG90S typically rotate within a range of 0° to 180°. Sending control signals outside this range may damage the servo or cause erratic behavior.

## 5. Battery 🔋

A rechargeable battery provides portable power to the robot, enabling it to operate without being tethered to a computer.

## 7. Important Ports 🛠️

The robot features two essential ports:

- **Micro-USB Port:**  
    Used for programming the ESP32 microcontroller and providing power during development. Connect this port to your computer to upload code or debug the robot.

- **USB Type-C Port:**  
    Dedicated to charging the robot’s battery via the control charge module. Use a standard USB Type-C cable to recharge the battery safely.
