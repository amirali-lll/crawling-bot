## 3. Add the Template Logic
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amirali-lll/crawling-bot.git
```
2. Create new Sketch in Arduino IDE **File > New Sketch**.
3. Copy the contents of `templates/template.ino` into your new sketch.
4. Save the sketch with a meaningful name.


## 4. Install Required Libraries üìö
1. Select the Library Manager from the Arduino IDE (It is located at the left side of the IDE).
2. Search for and install any libraries required by your project (Each library is mentioned in the `template.ino`)
